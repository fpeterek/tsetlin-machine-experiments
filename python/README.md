First, download the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshsaxenadn/car-vs-bike-classification-dataset).

```sh
# Extract the data
mkdir data
unzip archive.zip
mv Car-Bike-Dataset data

# Setup a Python environment
virtualenv venv --python=python3
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Preprocess the data so we can work with the images a bit easier
python3 src/preprocess.py
```

## Run

```sh
# Trains both models and serializes them into a file
python3 src/train.py
```
